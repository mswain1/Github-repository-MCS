Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.\n\nThis submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report.

With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City is composed of five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city has diverse demographics and a vibrant economy. A resident or visitor to the city can experience a vast array of cultures, including food, museums, and many other attractions.\nMy goal is to determine the best location to open a microbrewery and tap house in Brooklyn. Foursquare data will be used to determine location to similar venues that will attract foot traffic to the brewery."
